# Bullet Oasis!

Bullet Oasis was a little game implemented in my game design class at CalPoly.  Bullet Oasis was created in green foot (https://www.greenfoot.org/).  It is a fun little side scrolling 2D game about a cowboy that can freeze time.

There's nothing special here, but it was fun to make and I got credit for the class so who can complain!
